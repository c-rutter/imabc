Description: IMABC is a likelihood-free method for estimating the parameters of complex models that results in a 
    simulated sample from the posterior distribution of model parameters given targets. IMABC begins with a accept/reject 
    ABC step applied to a sample of points from the prior distribution of model parameters. Accepted points result in model 
    predictions that are within the initially specified tolerance intervals around the target points. The sample is 
    iteratively updated by drawing additional points from a mixture of multivariate normal distributions, accepting points 
    within tolerance intervals. As the algorithm proceeds, the acceptance intervals are narrowed. The algorithm returns 
    a set of points and sampling weights that account for the adaptive sampling scheme.
